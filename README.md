Hello there!

This repository is where I put my configurations files.
Here I have everything to setup my environment easily!

Some of the things that I use and has configurations file here:

- Bash;
- Vim and MacVim;
- Git;
- Tmux;
- Eslint;

Feel free to take a look :)

When I need to start from scratch, I just run this script that install every thing to me:

```curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diegoholiveira/dotfiles/master/setup.sh | bash```

**Important**: this script has one dependency that is required to run: Xcode must be installed
because MacVim needs it to compile!
