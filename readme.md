Hi! How are you? I hope you're fine.

Welcome to my dotfiles repository. Here is where I save my configurations.
Also, I have a script that install and configure my machine from scratch.

Feel free to take a look :)

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diegoholiveira/dotfiles/master/setup)"
```
