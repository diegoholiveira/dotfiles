# Enhanced JavaScript Syntax for Vim

### Credits
- Zhao Yi, Claudio Fleiner, Scott Shattuck (This file is based on their hard work)
- gumnos (From the #vim IRC Channel in Freenode) (Who helped me figured out the
  crazy Vim Regexes)

### Description
This file is a fork of [this file](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1491)
and [the stock one](http://fleiner.com/vim/download.html)

This version of this file features the following text highlights:

- Parenthesis, curly and regular brackets.
- The semicolon or comma at the end of line.
- Browser, DOM and "Ajax" keywords like objects, methods, properties and others.
- Operation, comparison and logical symbols (`=`,`==`,`===`,`!=`,etc.).
- Separate highlight of the arguments. Thanks to [Billychan](https://github.com/jelera/vim-javascript-syntax/commit/b03f40ff6ddf605ac146634a651632d6c1e8a50b).

To enable code folding add the following to your `.vimrc`.

```vim
au FileType javascript call JavaScriptFold()
```

### Installation
- Using [NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim) **(Which I recommend)**,
  add this line to your `.vimrc`

```vim
NeoBundleLazy 'jelera/vim-javascript-syntax', {'autoload':{'filetypes':['javascript']}}
```

- Using [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle),
  add this line to your `.vimrc`

```vim
Plugin 'jelera/vim-javascript-syntax'
```

- Using [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen),
  run this command in your shell

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jelera/vim-javascript-syntax.git ~/.vim/bundle/vim-javascript-syntax
```
### Suggested Companion Plugins
- **Indentation**, can be achieved with [Javascript-Indent](https://github.com/vim-scripts/JavaScript-Indent) by Preston Koprivica. On my testing, it has proved to be the most capable and also indents HTML and JS inside HTML.
The project is unmaintained for now, but you could fork it and improve upon it.
- **Autocompletion** by [Tern for Vim](https://github.com/marijnh/tern_for_vim)
- Popular **third-party libraries support** like jQuery, YUI, Prototype, by [javascript-libraries-syntax](https://github.com/othree/javascript-libraries-syntax.vim)
